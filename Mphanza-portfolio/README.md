# Mphanza-portfolio

A clean, responsive personal portfolio built with plain HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

This repository contains a static portfolio site for Michael Mphanza featuring:
- Home / Hero
- About
- Technical Skills
- Courses Completed
- Projects
- Contact

Theme: cool beige + dark brown (text is black) — designed for a sleek, professional look.

## Local preview
Open PowerShell and run the following in the project folder:

```powershell
Set-Location -Path "C:\Users\user\OneDrive\programming\Html\Mphanza-portfolio"
# Start a simple HTTP server (Python must be installed)
python -m http.server 8000
# Then open http://localhost:8000 in your browser
```

The site is static — no build step required.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Create a short `LICENSE` file (MIT) for you.
- Add a tailored `.gitignore` for web projects.
- Create and push the GitHub repo for you (I can run the commands here if you confirm).
